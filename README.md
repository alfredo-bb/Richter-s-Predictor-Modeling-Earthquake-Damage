Different tests realized

I have tested different encoding methods(OHE, Label Enconding and Target Encoding) to see
which one gave me the better score. This was Target Encoding

I have tested different classification models (gradient boosting classification,classification tree and  random forest classification) with cross validation over them to see which one gave the best scores

The model with the best score was random forest.

I have also tested gini and entropy and the parameter with the best score was gini.
